While the majority of customers will receive their orders in around 3-7 days from date of shipping there are cases where orders may be delayed by the postal system, delays of such are beyond our control.\n\nPlease note that we will sometimes ship multiple-order parcels separately to reduce delays.\n\nDesigner items are shipped from our lab in the UK while Budget Items are shipped from Hong Kong.\n\n***************************************************************************\n *********** IMPORTANT = DELAYS WITH DELIVERY OF YOUR ITEM *************\n***************************************************************************\n\nIf your order does not arrive within 10 days of dispatch, please do not worry; it is very likely that it will arrive very soon. In line with postal guidelines, we will not consider a package lost until 25 working days have passed. This is because the vast majority of packages will be delivered or returned to us as 'undeliverable' within this time.\n\nIf after 25 working days your order has still not arrived, please contact us at via our help and information pages on the website to arrange a free replacement. Please include your order number, name and the date of dispatch in your email. Your email together with a non-delivery form which we will issue you will be used as evidence of non-receipt in our claim our shippers. This does not apply to customer's own items or to reglazes which are sent at the customer's risk unless we agree otherwise in writing.\n\nTracking details will only apply to those parcels where tracking numbers are shown, otherwise they will ship by normal mail/airmail postal services without tracking numbers.\n\n***************************************************************************\n\nOrder Tracking & History Now Available!\nhttp://www.omnioptics.ca/account_profile.php\n\n***************************************************************************\n\nPlease Note: This is an automated email sent from an e-mail address that cannot receive e-mails.
